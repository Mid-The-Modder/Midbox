# Midbox V0
This is the real, more organized, and overall better version of the previous Midbox Beta. Midbox is a mod of Jummbox, which in turn, is a mod of Beepbox. Beepbox is a music program that is capable of a lot more than what it seems.

Beepbox was made by John Nesky / Shaktool, and Jummbox was made by Jummbus. 

This mod as of right now plans to add more customizability to Beepbox.
