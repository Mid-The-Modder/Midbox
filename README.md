# Midbox V0.2.5
## "V0.2 Finalizing"
This is the real, more organized, and overall better version of the previous Midbox Beta. Midbox is a mod of Jummbox, which in turn, is a mod of Beepbox. Beepbox is a music program that is capable of a lot more than what it seems.

Beepbox was made by John Nesky / Shaktool, and Jummbox was made by Jummbus. 

This mod as of right now plans to add more customizability to Beepbox.

Here is the changelog for credits and information on what is added into Midbox.
